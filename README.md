# CondItional-GAN-on-Cifar-10-Dataset
This model can be modified to include additional inputs, y, on which the models can be conditioned. y can be any type of additional inputs, for example, class labels. The conditioning can be achieved by simply feeding y to both the Generator — G(z|y) and the Discriminator — D(x|y).
